# üì• Install & OS Support

- If you have Go 1.21+ then run: `go install github.com/furtidev/usbfetch@latest`. The executable will be available in `$GOPATH/bin`.
- If you don't have Go or don't want to bother compiling,  check the [latest release](https://github.com/furtidev/usbfetch/releases/latest). You can download precompiled executables from there. Both `amd64` and `i386` architectures are supported. 

And then run the executable in your terminal.
